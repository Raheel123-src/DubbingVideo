[0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.000]  What is the most effective podcast format solo monologue episodes?
[0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:09.000]  Yes, where it's just you speaking one on one with your listener,
[0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:11.000]  because podcasting is the most intimate format out there.
[0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:14.000]  You're literally inside someone's head talking to them.
[0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:20.000]  So solo episodes are about 38% more effective, 38% higher engagement or consumption
[0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:24.000]  rate than conversational followed by interview interview.
[0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:25.000]  Are the most oversaturated format?
[0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:27.000]  I would steer clear of them.
[0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:31.000]  Even if you're an amazing interview, there's just too many interview podcasts out there today.
